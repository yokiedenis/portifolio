Maybe the madness in those fanatics, petroheads, enthusiast perhaps even creatives, may simply means these fellows might be seeing a bridge a future we cannot see yet. </p>
        <p>its good to plan ahead and carry a boat all you life till you reach the bridge then use it and carry it forward. or you could just go with people and build or future generations a ladder rather bridge. perhaps we can let the gods walk a step ahead for us all.</p>
        <p>what if its no bridge but a desert, those carrying useless boats could feel cheated. hahaha. then there's gods mistake the cains the Psychopathy, cursed to forever roam,perhaps we leave the exploration to these leaders as we conviently stay behind.</p>
