        <p>"they" say cross the bridge when you reach it, but the world is run by men that crossed the bridge in their minds way ahead of the average joe. Maybe the madness in those fanatics, petroheads, enthusiast perhaps even creatives, may simply means these fellows might be seeing a bridge rather a future we cannot see yet. </p>
        <p>it's good to plan ahead and carry a boat all your life till you reach the bridge then use it and carry it forward. or you could just go with people and build for future generations a ladder rather bridge. perhaps we can let the gods walk a step ahead for us all.</p>
        <p>what if it's that their's no bridge but a desert, those carrying useless boats could feel cheated. hahaha. then there's the gods mistake the cains, the misfits, the outcast, the Psychopaths, cursed to forever wander and wonder, perhaps we leave the exploration to these leaders as we conveniently stay behind. perhaps...</p>
