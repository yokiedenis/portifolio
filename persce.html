            <p>"they" say cross the bridge when you reach it, but the world is run by men that crossed the bridge in their minds way ahead of the average joe. Maybe the madness in those fanatics, petroheads, enthusiast perhaps even creatives, may simply means these fellows might be seeing a bridge rather a future we cannot see yet. </p>
            <p>it's good to plan ahead and carry a boat all your life till you reach the bridge then use it and carry it forward. or you could just go with people and build for future generations a ladder rather bridge. perhaps we can let the gods walk a step ahead for us all.</p>
            <p>what if it's that their's no bridge but a desert, those carrying useless boats could feel cheated. hahaha. then there's the gods mistake the cains, the misfits, the outcast, the Psychopaths, cursed to forever wander and wonder, perhaps we leave the exploration to these leaders as we conveniently stay behind. perhaps...</p>

            <p>"As the current trend among the christian community, God is a Person, and in the deep of His mighty nature He thinks, wills, enjoys, feels, loves, desires and suffers as any other person may. In making Himself known to us He stays by the familiar pattern of personality." hmmmmm so God[Yaweh] has to hide himself to expose himself, to go west to reach east, to look inward and find your outside expression of self. i don't intended to be religious or movemental i find it usesless to divide the human like Nimrod, perhaps we speak one and global village with AI,"our future generations will have big heads with big brains" till we invented a brain."Now we marry lazily for familiarity to our neighbour</p>

            <P>"they say wisdom cannot be inherited or learnt" i have seen a man capture his entire life in a book ,hmmmm isn't that wisdom, "a man that cannot learn from another mans mistakes perhaps cannot be wise" We read not for amusement or growth or even knowledge, we read to live, so that we become that that we read on a sub conscious ego level "GiGa" garbage in garbage out... [as within as without as above as below is a cross [ + ]</P>
