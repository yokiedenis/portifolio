          "they" say cross the bridge when you reach it, but the world is run by
          men that crossed the bridge in their minds way ahead of the average
          joe. Maybe the madness in those fanatics, petroheads, enthusiast
          perhaps even creatives, may simply means these fellows might be seeing
          a bridge rather a future we cannot see yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          it's good to plan ahead and carry a boat all your life till you reach
          the bridge then use it and carry it forward. or you could just go with
          people and build for future generations a ladder rather bridge.
          perhaps we can let the gods walk a step ahead for us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          what if it's that their's no bridge but a desert, those carrying
          useless boats could feel cheated. hahaha. then there's the gods
          mistake the cains, the misfits, the outcast, the Psychopaths, cursed
          to forever wander and wonder, perhaps we leave the exploration to
          these leaders as we conveniently stay behind. perhaps...

          "As the current trend among the christian community, God is a Person,
          and in the deep of His mighty nature He thinks, wills, enjoys, feels,
          loves, desires and suffers as any other person may. In making Himself
          known to us He stays by the familiar pattern of personality." hmmmmm
          so God[Yaweh] has to hide himself to expose himself, to go west to
          reach east, to look inward and find your outside expression of self. i
          don't intended to be religious or movemental i find it usesless to
          divide the human like Nimrod, perhaps we speak one and global village
          with AI,"our future generations will have big heads with big brains"
          till we invented a brain."Now we marry lazily for familiarity to our
          neighbour

          "they say wisdom cannot be inherited or learnt" i have seen a man
          capture his entire life in a book ,hmmmm isn't that wisdom, "a man
          that cannot learn from another mans mistakes perhaps cannot be wise"
          We read not for amusement nor growth nor even knowledge, we read to
          live, so that we become that that we read on a sub conscious ego level
          "GiGa" garbage in garbage out... [as within as without as above as

        “You can stop suffering. You can really stop suffering completely, right
        here and right now. All you have to do is to give up everything you
        think. You have to give up your opinions, you have to give up your
        beliefs, and you have to even give up believing in your own name. You
        have to give all this up, but that’s all you have to do. “Like Jesus
        said to the rich man, leave everything and follow me.

        “All my life, I thought of love as some kind of voluntary enslavement.:
        freedom only exists when love is present.. And the person who loves
        wholeheartedly feels free. Although she believed that love is the only
        true experience of freedom, and that no one can possess anyone else."
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain things cannot be shared. Nor can we be afraid of the oceans into
        which we plunge of our own free will; fear cramps everyone's style. Man
        goes through hell in order to understand this. Love one another, but
        let's not try to possess one another. I love this man sitting before me
        now, because I do not possess him and he does not possess me. We are
        free in our mutual surrender; I need to repeat this dozens, hundreds,
        millions of time, until I finally believe my own words

        "Love" compilation and notes by mayoka denis 
      </h3>
      <p>
        Love is superior to moral judgment, that true love transcends, forgives and survives every manner of Evil in its object, and the greater the love the greater the immorality it permits to the loved. To love a man for his virtues is petty and human, it tells you; to love him for his flaws is divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self-interest; to love the unworthy is sacrifice; as lovers who never discovered their love.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        True Love is a pure emotion of the spirit. To love is to value, Love is the expression of one’s values. Love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, that quality consists, not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice, that the noblest love is born, not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to values, but in response to flaws—and he will have cut himself into two people haha,420
