    <h3>ehh cheizere that was ahhhh, lets start from the start then, self love first love by ivan turgenev</h3>
    <h4>self love</h4>
    <p>You are quite possibly infected with the sepsis of low-esteem, and the only known cure is a massive dose of self-love. But perhaps, like many in our society, you’ve grown up with the idea that loving yourself is wrong, perhaps selfish. In order to say "I love you" you must first have an "I" Few do.</p>
    <h4>In the winter of my love is hate</h4>
    <p>Born of a range of emotions, Hate can be erotic or platonic, but unlike love, Hate is not the opposite of love. The opposite of Hate is apathy—a bread that requires no teeth… My work is concerned with turning self-hate into productive, powerful, disciplined hatred. But I am no hypocrite when it comes to “loving my hate.” We love to hate, and hate to love. Love is finite, there is an end to it. Hate is infinite, there is no end to it, My love is camouflage for murder, hate, bad manners, disrespect, and intrusion on the life of others, Kill me and I will love you—</p>
    <br>
    <p>You perhaps already hate yourself for not being good enough to get Unconditional love, approval, acceptance, continual support and resources from your parents/family/friends/society. This is the basic human riddle: you start out by hating yourself for no reason other than you don’t get what you want when you want it, and you believe this is your fault. You work hard trying to get rid of your hated parts and become something lovable, and in the process realize that you will at times be hated for this, maybe even rejected and feel the withdrawal of love. Most people stop somewhere in this paradox—in this diabolical double bind—trapped…adding to their self-hate. They try to escape through distractions and chemicals, and they invent concepts and mind games that give them points for “being who they are”…while secretly wishing they were something powerful and worthwhile. Do I have the capacity to "love" myself at my worst? The essence of marriage through love is to heal these inner child-like mindset so that if (if-3) a divorce happens both parties are left in a better place to deal with the world or perhaps the next.</p>
    <h4>i see myself in you</h4>
    <p>What a messy business it is to be fallen for" by the more literary "What uneasiness lies in being loved." In my case such an expression as "to be fallen for" or even "to be loved" is not in the least appropriate; perhaps it describes the situation more accurately to say that I was "really" looked at by someone or after like a cute pet perhaps a trophy."</p>
    <p>Eve, mentioned throughout the novel. She is mentioned as the universal mother, a form of the Jungian “Earth Mother who not only signals the fall but also with her son brings salvation. All have meaning. In hating or loving someone, one hates or loves something in oneself. “The things we see,” says Pistorius, “are the same things that are in us. There is no reality other than what we have inside us.”</p>
    <h4>tote'αil break</h4>
    <p>I would turn over on my belly with a grunt and, puffing on a cigarette, begin, "I'm told that some men heat their bath water by burning the love letters they get from women." "As a matter of fact, I have boiled milk that way—and drunk it too."</p>
    <p>"They say that love flies out the window when poverty comes in the door, but people generally get the sense backwards. It doesn't mean that when a man's money runs out he's shaken off by women. When he runs out of money, he naturally is in the dumps. Finally, in desperation, he shakes and shakes and shakes till he shakes off the woman. It isn't too hard for me to understand that feeling myself!</p>

    <h4>mutual surrender</h4>
    <p>Slaves need hope, and the fact that they can talk and babble and write poems proves to them that love is, love was, and love will always be. Love makes the world go round. Love is their freedom, pity is their bed—sweet dreams. For its slaves that seek material possessions like land, houses and so forth, free men seek freedom, to stretch out their hands and feel no walls, to seek their inner most revelations. <br>
        Selling love is the biggest business in the world, selling caring, selling philanthropy… selling hopes and dreams…that is the business, the word “love” is like the word “guarantee” How do you determine the worth of a guarantee? Say the word to someone, and they will quickly fill in what it means…to them. And what it means to them may have nothing to do with what it means to you or to me.
        </p>
        <h4>build up</h4>
<p>“I thought I could not bear seeing her next to me without taking her in my arms.” But the wise woman he loves senses this at once and teaches restrain. “You mustn’t have wishes you don’t believe in. I know what you wish for”.

</p><p> With her kiss, Demian infuses the unwelcoming outlook of war and death with spiritual hope. She tells Demian, “The next time you call me, I won’t come so obviously on boda or by car. You will have to listen inside yourself, and then you’ll realize I’m in you”. Once again, she paraphrases the words of Jesus: “And behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world”
    All I wanted to do was try to live the life that was inside me, trying to get out. Why was that so hard?
