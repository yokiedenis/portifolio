    <h3>Allow me to introduce</h3>
    <p>So am building a blog in mern stack, but baby steps lets H the mail it first, given its the month of love as i compile and write this.; as god's mistress wisdom says in the holy book, whats chasing you is chasing you, she follows you behind as you shout out her name in the river between, i hope to simply know it perhaps (perscecast), to think about it and offer a perspective thats if you can indulge in the writings on her walls</p>
    <br><h4>"knock knock who" come inside after eleven minutes i will tell you</h4>
    <p>Two people who live together and love each other need to adjust
        the hands of their clocks, with patience and perseverance, games and 'theatrical
        representations', until they realise that making love is more than just an
        encounter, it is a genital 'embrace'.
        Everything is important. If you live your life intensely, you experience
        pleasure all the time and don't feel the need for sex. When you have sex, it's out
        of a sense of abundance, because the glass of wine is so full that it overflows
        naturally, because it is inevitable, because you are responding to the call of
        life, because at that moment, and only at that moment, you have allowed
        yourself to lose control.
        </p>
        <h4>sex for infinite beings</h4>
        <p>
            'Anyone who is observant, who discovers the person they have always
dreamed of, knows that sexual energy comes into play before sex even takes
place. The greatest pleasure isn't sex, but the passion with which it is practised.
When the passion is intense, then sex joins in to complete the dance, but it is
never the principal aim.'
'Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're
not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay
together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the
next, or -
such is the pleasure they experience - they may never finish it. No eleven
minutes for them.

        <h4>An artists date with the muse</h4>
        <p>He's an artist. He should know that the great aim of every human being is to understand the meaning of total love. Love is not to be found in someone else, but in ourselves; we simply awaken it. But in order to do that, we need the other person. The universe only makes sense when we have someone to share our feelings with.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder; color: greenyellow;">my loves die even before they're born'. I lose the love i have before i win the love i hope to get...</span><br> A writer once
            said that it is not time that changes man, nor knowledge; the only thing that can change someone's mind is love. What nonsense! But if I don't think about love, I will be nothing. <br> Missed chances. The roller coaster is my life; life is a fast, dizzying game;  life is a parachute jump; it's taking chances, falling over and getting up again; it's mountaineering; it's wanting to get to the very top of yourself and to feel angry and dissatisfied when you don't manage it.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder; color: greenyellow;">The greatest tragedy of man is that he almost had it all</span>
            </p>
            <h4>If you want it bad enough, the universe conspires to your aid</h4>
            <p>When we meet someone and fall in love, we have a sense that the whole universe is on our side. And yet if something goes wrong, there is nothing left! No heroes, no distant music. Although my aim is to understand love, and although I suffer to think of the people to whom I gave my heart, I see that those who touched my heart failed to arouse my body, and that those who aroused my body failed to touch my heart." everything was love and surrender. But then the serpent appeared and said to Eve: what you surrendered, you will lose. That is how it was with me - I was driven out of paradise when I was still at school, and ever since then, I have been trying to find a way of telling the serpent he was wrong, that living was more important than keeping things to yourself. But the serpent was right and I was wrong</p>
            <h4>i want you to want me so badly, so badly, get on your one knee and beg </h4>
            <p>
                Knowing that she was desired
                excited her more than anything else. It had nothing to do with the automatic
                formula - I want to make love with you, I want to get married, I want you to
                have an orgasm, I want you to have my child, I want commitment. I would like to be able to teach you where to touch my body, how much pressure to apply, for how long, I would like to be able to teach you where to touch my body, how much pressure to apply, for how long, to go beyond what people conventionally call “making love”.  To be desired
                was an entirely free sensation, loose in the air, vibrating, filling life with the
                will to have something - and that was enough, that will carried all before it,
                moved mountains, made her wet.
                
            </p>
            <h4>Loving you may not be my choice but choosing you is my choice</h4>
            <p>
                Yes, I love you very much, as I have never loved another, and that is
precisely why I am leaving, because, if I stayed, the dream would become
reality, the desire to possess, to want your life to be mine ... in short, all the
things that transform love into slavery. It's best left like this - a dream - lovers in secret. We have
to be careful what we take from a country, or from life. If I must be faithful to someone or something, then I have, first of all, to be faithful to myself. If I'm looking for true love, I first have to get the mediocre loves out of my system. Anyone who has lost something they thought was theirs forever finally comes to realise that nothing really belongs to them. Everyone is an experience.

            </p>
            <h4>Out of sight, out of mind</h4>
            <p>
                “What the eyes
don't see, the heart doesn't grieve over.” Well, I say that there isn't an °unce of
truth in it. The further off they are, the closer to the heart are all those feelings
that we try to repress and forget. If we're in exile, we want to store away every
tiny memory of our roots. If we're far from the person we love, everyone we
pass in the street reminds us of them.
'The gospels and all the sacred texts of all religions were written in exile,
in search of God's understanding, of the faith that moves whole peoples, of the
pilgrimage of souls wandering the face of the Earth. Our ancestors did not
know, as we do not know, what the Divinity expects from our lives and it is out
of that doubt that books are written, pictures painted, because we don't want to
forget who we are - nor can we.'
