    I am I here and now, not my words or thoughts. i find it entertaining to

  <h4>strange thoughts perscast, open minded conversations for purposes of reseach</h4>
  <h4>day 1/100 coding challenge(context)</h4>
  <p>Philosophy aims to ask the right questions while theology aims to answer, am scholar of life under the sun and below are some of my insights from various books some banned in certain countries and religious circles, the essence of this introduction is to give context to the topics I discuss below, at first I thought of this thought or trains of thought as mechanism to break down my programming that is to say social, political, religious, egoistic attachments and so forth, I constantly  killed my ego, suspended it completely but it always came back, these words arranged like this would help me stay centred. As I started out, my main aim was to understand the big questions, as a curious intellectual in today’s world it’s easy to slip into nihilism just by being reasonably updated. My entire being, my sense of self, my personality, my name or even nickname, my loves, my passions, my very essence, everything I cared about, my reality, my I am I , was drained, I felt like the ground underneath me was swept away and I way falling, I still am actually falling that is, I read somewhere that monks like the ones that are always sweeping the ground with their brooms in films have a habit of asking the student weird questions or even strange tasks with the sole reason of inducing this state of mind. Some call it being lost but me I think it feels like Satan when he was fallen. I discovered that floating is a comfort in such times, that is to allow anything coming you way to sweep you as well, it’s like you falling but you cling to any trend that’s moving, surfing a wave, or allow people into your life and transfer the responsibility of decision making to them, cause now you don’t even know who you think you are, that inert bagisu clans men pride gone, you become nothingness, to be, you become a teacher that’s useless to the matrix, you go to the very root of man, the beginning where nothing exists, my church friends kept on talking about the light and darkness but this place has neither light or darkness, it just is. No reason, no why, just existing, so I have been existing for a while now, as I write this I discover that I had no reason to question, when I already know the answer, but what can I say, I was compelled to question everything, to at least enlighten my children, to seek truth and perhaps imprint to then when they are young, to seek depth, my pastor says why do you seek and seek when all you answers are in your neighbour that is to love your neighbour and probably drown in the delight of it, but I think it’s the role of the hero or the villain to leave his woman’s haven and answer the calling of that that has been here before us, the bible talks about divine knowledge hidden before the world was created that even if it was broadcasted on tv or shared in tweets, only a few would understand it, am also concerned about consequences, I am a kind of spirit now that knows not of the laws of humans, but I fear their consequences, the law of karma says one can make good decision, and can actually trace back even years later to a point in time where they made a bad decision that change their reality negatively, karma simply put is what wisdom says in proverbs that the sheep don’t need protection from the wolves because  the way of life or rather the life style protects them already, do good and good comes back to you, or do bad and it catches up to you, that’s karma innit.</p>
  <p>The first thing I discovered is a belief system, where god does exist or not, let me explain to you how a belief system would work let’s say in the Christian faith, I choose this because it’s my primary religion that I grew up it, attending catholic boarding school and so forth, so a person let’s say Linda wants to buy a car, so she prays to god to get the car, she puts her faith in a higher power, by faith in that higher power especially with even deeper faith mechanism like love yes love actually boosts your spiritual gifts somehow, fasting, constant prayer, she has literary pushed that desire for a car into her sub conscious mind through repetition, the sub conscious mind starts to do a self-fulling kinda of prophecy “law of attraction”, she starts saving, or working harder for that promotion, the sub conscious mind works in odd ways for example if you walk into a room looking for a bucket, you won’t notice the cup colour or book title if asked to recall, the sub conscious mind filters out and keeps what it thinks is important, by a belief system either whether a person believes in a higher power  to get the car and then blame Satan or timing for not achieving it, one can build their own belief system to help them get that car either in belief in oneself(manifestation)  or a group(cult) or an individual(pastors, pope, fathers, mentors, etc.). As my uncle told me once, be a chicken, chicken is for the smart and pork is for the fools, I now understand a little, a chicken scratches the group and using its legs sorts through looking for seeds to eat, just like that chicken one can learn from all the religions in the world including the mysteries, pick what works for him and build an entire belief system out of the various parts that would be customised for him individually but the key for this to work and not just create a new dogma (amgod) or new gods for themselves to worship, it requires individuality, it’s a journey of looking inward to understand what really works for you, its journey only you can walk, but afraid not many walk this journey to truth or nirvana or enlightenment, like the born agains like to say you slate is wiped clean and you start afresh however they attribute this principle to Jesus of Nazareth from the holy book. Now that I thinking about jhus let me give you a different perspective perhaps (perscast) about Jesus.
So Jesus and the disciples are on their way back from Bethany and Jesus is starving, he’s body is craving or hungering, as with the body, it has more wisdom in it that most, I remember that one time God of the bible Yahweh was asked to explain himself, this is the only point in the bible where a man has guts to ask god who are you and not just wrestle him,  “what do you want from us?”, some say praise him every day, but this time we have asked him directly and kind enough he answers job in the book of job, he goes on and own about how he cannot comprehend how the world works but the entire time he kept on talking about nature, the only time he has to answer us he goes on and on about mother nature, the universe rather nature has more wisdom that most, the white man studied nature before anything else, studying psychology and so forth, this is how he was able to conquer Africa the black continent, ahem, off topic, back to our chicken, so study Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, occultism, etc. all have truth in them that can help you live a better life or even that calm mind that comes with understanding, ahem, back to Jesus, yeah so Jesus was hungry and on his way he saw a fig tree in the distance, he sees it has healthy leaves, but somehow nobody told Jesus the figs are out of season, side step: bear with me though( my pastor says Jesus’s timing is so off, when he comes the second time he won’t care if your out of season, you don’t bear fruit, its hell for you) hmmmm that fear spreading again hmmm nice for children to behave) some cultists are pissed cause the Christians are worshiping death claiming that “these guys want a person who died centuries ago to come and rule us”, and the Muslims claim he died a virgin and he will come back again and get married, ahem, oh sorry, so he sees these very health leaves but when approaches the tree for some fruit, it’s not there, “i don’t know what happened” but he cursed the tree and it died, the disciples found it dried up and he explained to them about faith, so a friend tells me he did this to teach the disciples about faith in regards to curses or blessings, like if you’re not invited in that town , rub your feet on the ground and move, as for me I thought of it as hypocrisy where some people show on the outside(leaves) that they have fruit, all these monies, all these connections, but in reality they don’t, such people should be ahh forget it, another person whose quite good at connecting dots tells me the tree represents the old testament where the laws of Moses are like the leaves but bear no fruit, btw the Germans say that when you get in the  spirit you just live in accordance to the laws of the land somehow without even knowing then for its those without understanding that the law of Moses applies. Ahem, back to my interpretation of this story, to me, Jesus simply tells me that with a physical body you’re prone to hunger, emotions, hormones and even the greatest among us can make mistakes when driven by bodily desire. Simply put, a hungry stomach is an angry one. Thanks for following my perscast even when its in its rough sketches, a godness watching Olaf (from frozen) paint told me your first work is bullshit, but with continuous effort it can get better, for an apprentice to become the master he must embrace stupidity and soak up all the master’s knowledge and then he can create as a master after acquiring the skill. That’s it for today, see ya tomorrow, I will be diving deeper in mysteries with summary and notes of Perhaps an Austin Osman Spare the Psychology of Ecstasy, off-to-code

<p>PS:there could be another side to the story, hmmmmm </p>
