    <blockquote>
        “Lord of a thousand worlds am I, and I reign since time began; and night and day, in cyclic sway, Shall pass while their deeds I scan.  Yet time shall cease ere I ﬁnd release, for I AM the soul of Man”

    <h4>lesson 1 Individuality</h4>
    <p>Each and every person must work out his own Success, along the lines of his own Individuality, instead of along some cut‑and‑dried plan. “Along the lines of his own individuality,” then it must follow that one must possess Individuality before he may work along its “lines.” And in the measure that he possesses Individuality, so will he possess the first prerequisite to Success. And that is what we mean by “The Secret of Success”—Individuality 
        “Individuality is the expression of our Self—that self which is what we mean when we say “I””
        In fact, leadership comes this way because of this self‑assertive, and self‑directive quality. If they had stood back in a modest, mild manner, they would have been pushed aside by the flock that would disclaim them as leaders, in favour of others who knew how to push to the front. However note that the great men—the strong men—care nothing for the flock, which so obediently trots along after them.
        In the first place there is the “I,” which is the Real Self or the Individual, and there is the “Me,” which is something attached to and belonging to the “I”—the Personality.
        </p>
        <h4>lesson 2 the "i"</h4>
        <p>The Free Expression of the Individual - the “I”, you must ﬁrst awaken to a realization of what the Individual - the “I” within you - really is.
            Many people are in the habitat of regarding their bodies as the “I” part of them, but a little consideration will show them that the body is but a material covering, or machine through which and by means of which the “I” is able to manifest itself.
            </p>
            <p>You are aware that your mental states change - your emotions vary - your feelings differ from time to time - your very ideas and thoughts are inconsistent and are subject to outside inﬂuences, or else are moulded and governed by that which you call “I”, or your Real Self. Then there must be something behind Mental States, Ideas, Feelings, Thoughts, etc., which is superior to them and which “knows” them just as one knows a thing apart from itself but which it uses. You Say “I” feel; “I” think; “I” believe; “I” know; “I” will; etc. etc. Now which is the Real Self? The Mental States just mentioned or the “I” Which is the subject or Real Cause Of the mental phenomena? It is not the Mind that knows, but the “I” Which uses the Mind In order to know.
                The awakening to a realization of the “I”, in its clearness and vividness, will cause you to feel a sense of being and Power that you have never before known. Before you can express Individuality, you must realize that you are an Individual.
                </p>
        <h4>lesson 3 the "Me"</h4>  
        <p>The “Me” side of you is what is called Personality, to the outer appearance of yourself. Your Personality is made up of countless characteristics, traits, habits, thoughts, expressions and motions - it is a bunch of peculiarities and personal traits that you have been thinking was the real “I” all this time. But it is not.</p>  
        <p>Do you know what the idea of Personality arose from? Let us tell you. Turn to the pages of any good dictionary, and you will see that the word originated from the Latin word “Persona”, meaning “a mask used by actors in ancient times”, and which the word in turn was derived from two other words, “sonare,” meaning to “sound,” and “per,” meaning ”through,” the two words combined meaning “to sound through” - the idea being that the voice of the actor sounded through the mask of the assumed personality or character. Webster gives the following as one of the meanings of “Person,” even to this day: “A character or part, as in a play; an assumed character.” So then, Personality means the part you are playing in the Great Play of Life, on the Stage of the Universe. The real Individual concealed behind the mask of Personality is YOU - the Real Self - the “I” - that part of you which you are conscious when you say “I AM,”</p>
