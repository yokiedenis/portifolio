    <h4>lesson 1 Individuality</h4>
    <p>Each and every person must work out his own Success, along the lines of his own Individuality, instead of along some cut‑and‑dried plan. “Along the lines of his own individuality,” then it must follow that one must possess Individuality before he may work along its “lines.” And in the measure that he possesses Individuality, so will he possess the first prerequisite to Success. And that is what we mean by “The Secret of Success”—Individuality 
        “Individuality is the expression of our Self—that self which is what we mean when we say “I””
        In fact, leadership comes this way because of this self‑assertive, and self‑directive quality. If they had stood back in a modest, mild manner, they would have been pushed aside by the flock that would disclaim them as leaders, in favour of others who knew how to push to the front. However note that the great men—the strong men—care nothing for the flock, which so obediently trots along after them.
        In the first place there is the “I,” which is the Real Self or the Individual, and there is the “Me,” which is something attached to and belonging to the “I”—the Personality.
